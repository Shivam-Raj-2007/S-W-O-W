The Taj Mahal ('Crown of the Palace) is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna <br>
in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658)<br>
to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is  <br>
the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal  <br>
gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. <br><br>
